My drum tech, Pel and I really love this ground breaking device because while I'm out on tour with P!NK, Pel can make every drum sound exactly that way we love it every night with the extensive memorized tunings stored in the Tune-bot.

I've been using it on the road and in sessions.

Try Tune-Bot tuner, the perfect tuner!!!"</p>
<p>"I use DW drums, as you know the shells are matched according to pitch. I have programmed my Tune-Bot according to the pitch stamped inside each shell. So, when I put new heads on the drums, I don't have to waste time trying to find the right tuning. And as I tighten the head, the Tune-Bot is already set to tell me if the pitch is up or down, no time wasted" </p></div>
